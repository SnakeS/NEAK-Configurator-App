NEAK Configurator App
An app for controlling NEAK kernel options from an application for those who do not like to use CWM.

Current version is in Alpha build, and does not provide any functionality. Currently this app is a UI with code
to read which modules are currently enabled on the kernel.

To be added in the next commit is functionality.
